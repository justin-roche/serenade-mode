;; The list of default mappings corresponding to built in Serenade commands. These are exluded from autogenerated js because Serenade already contains the speech patterns. Serenade itself will handle "copy <target>" and "cut <target>", sending a diff message and populating the system clipboard, so these are not included. Serenades built-in "paste" command is also sufficient for sending a diff with the correct result.
